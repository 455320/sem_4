## Development Philosophy

### AI-Assisted Development Approach

My development methodology has evolved to optimize the use of AI tools while maintaining full architectural control:

#### Core Principles
1. **AI as Junior Developer, Human as Architect**
   - I design system architecture and workflows
   - AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) generate implementation code
   - I review, understand, and customize all generated code

2. **Learning Through Orchestration**
   - Not blind copy-pasting ("vibecoding without understanding")
   - Following complete workflows with comprehension
   - Adapting AI-generated code to personal style and project needs

3. **Theory Before Implementation**
   - Understand concepts through research (YouTube, documentation)
   - Use AI to accelerate implementation
   - Validate understanding by explaining and documenting

#### Workflow Example (OneTimeShare Project)
```
1. Research Redis TTL architecture → (YouTube, docs)
2. Design system architecture → (UUIDs, atomic operations)
3. Use AI to generate boilerplate → (ChatGPT)
4. Customize and debug → (Personal code review)
5. Document learnings → (Daily logs, technical notes)
6. Share publicly → (LinkedIn, GitHub)
```

This approach combines the speed of AI-assisted development with the depth of human understanding.
